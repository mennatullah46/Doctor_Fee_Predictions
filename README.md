# Doctor_Fee_Predictions

# Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a robust predictive model for estimating doctor consultation fees. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset containing both continuous and discrete features, we explore various machine learning techniques to provide accurate fee predictions. The project encompasses the full machine learning pipeline, from meticulous data preprocessing to the application and evaluation of diverse regression and classification models.


# Regression Models Applied:
Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

Linear Regression: A fundamental statistical model to model the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables.

Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBMRegressor): A highly efficient gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms. Known for its speed and accuracy.

Gradient Boosting Regressor: An ensemble learning method that builds models in a stage-wise fashion, and it generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function.

# Classification Models Applied:
Random Forest Classifier: Similar to its regression counterpart, used for discrete fee categories or ranges.

XGBoost Classifier: An optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible, and portable.

Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBMClassifier): The classification variant of LGBM, offering similar benefits of speed and performance.
